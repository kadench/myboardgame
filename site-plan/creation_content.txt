Creation
On this page, you will first find all the software used to create the parts and pieces of the game, and second you will
find the name, an example image, it's dimensions, and any suggestions I have when going about making your own game. I hope
this information is helpful.

Inkscape
Inkscape is a free to use, open source, scalable vector graphic (svg) editing software that is perfect for making the graphics
for your Monopoly game. If you don't know, an svg is a graphic or image that doesn't pixelate, ever. You can scale the image as
big or as small as you want and the image will still look crisp. While it may take some getting used to, there are a ton of useful
YouTube channels (such as Logos by Nick) and useful documentation on how to use this sofware with ease.

Online Editing Software
There are many useful online tools to edit images you have to the way you want them. However, many of them require you to pay for
their services after a certain use. Lunapic is a great, free online image editor that I have used for a few years now, and it seems
to do a decent job. If you would like to check it out/use it for yourself, please feel free to do so. Always make sure you trust a
website/service before uploading/downloading any content. (Use this or any software at your own risk!)

The Board
The Monopoly board was the first thing I worked on. I didn't really know what I was doing with the first draft, but I kept on refining 
the board until I got it to a point I like. If you decide to use Inkscape for this, please make sure to put each of the property tiles 
in their own layer! as I found out, the file starts lagging if you don't do this! It may take some time to get the desired look, so 
please be aware that the design may need to be done more than once!
Dimensions: 19 1/2" x 19 1/2"

Game Cards
The key for the game cards is to look on the internet for design ideas. Creating a card design idea can be tough, but with enough work,
it will be done well. For my game, I decided to design the backs of the Monopoly board cards on my own, but the property deeds are inspired
by the backs of the property deeds from the Mega Monopoly Edition. All the game cards are the same size.
Dimensions: 2" x 3 1/8"

Money
The money you use for your Monopoly money doesn't have to be made by you. You could just take the already existing money from a Monopoly game
that you have lying around. Make sure you have permission to use it though! You can, however, make your own Monopoly money from scratch. When
I was making my money, I followed a tutorial from Logos by Nick. It creates a similar-ish border effect on the money like you see in the original.
Dimensions: 4" x 2"

Tokens
Same as the money, you can use the existing tokens you find in an already existing Monopoly game, but if you want to make your own, I can tell
you how I made mine. I found a website that 3D prints in metal because I really wanted to have custom tokens made of bronze in my game. Although
this was a fun thought, I'd advise you not to do this if you want to save money. If you still want to make custom tokens, make sure the dimensions
of the tokens are what you really want. I made the mistake of ordering the tokens and they came out too small. Click here to use the service I did
to make my tokens.
