My Massive Monopoly project (creating a MASSIVE version based off of Winning Moves Games Mega Monopoly) has been an
awesome experience. I have grown up loving Monopoly. I've been playing the game for as long as I can remember, so the
thought of creating my own version of Monopoly has always been on my mind. I started this project back in 2020, and I
just wanted to make it possible for others like me to create their own Monopoly game. I'd like to share the progress
I've made over these years, however, I haven't shared mostly anything on my version of the game in worry of distributing
copyrighted material on the internet, If you have any questions about this website, your game, or mine, please feel free
