# Massive Monopoly Project

## Disclaimer
I do not claim any ownership over any of Monopoly's copyrighted material. The MASSIVE Monopoly board game, with all of it's components, is a personal project that I do not intend to sell or distribute. 

## Overview

Welcome to the Massive Monopoly project repository! This website is a school project, and it showcases my version of the popular Monopoly game, which I've been working on. While the content may be relatively simple, it provides an overview of the project's essence, design elements, and the tools I used for its creation. The MASSIVE Monopoly board game itself is a personal project that I wanted to share, so I made it part of my final project in the WDD130 course.

## Purpose

**This repository is my final project for the WDD130 course** which serves as a simple documentation of my journey in creating my version of the Monopoly game. It's designed to highlight the core aspects of my game and provide insights into its creation process, with a focus on brevity and clarity.

## Pages

### [Home](https://kadench.github.io/myboardgame/index.html)

The Home page offers an introduction to Monopoly and the basis of my version. I also discuss the software and resources I used during the creation of my game.

### [Creation](https://kadench.github.io/myboardgame/creation.html)

On the Creation page, I provide a straight forward description of the software I use and the original Monopoly game's elements and a simplified overview of the creation process for each component.

### [Contact](https://kadench.github.io/myboardgame/contactme.html)

The Contact page offers a brief 'About Me' section and my contact information, should you wish to get in touch.
(The styling for this page is not done, but will be done next week.)
