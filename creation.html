                Inkscape is a free to use, open source, scalable vector graphic (SVG) editing software that is perfect for making the graphics
                for your Monopoly game. If you don't know, an SVG is a graphic or image that doesn't pixelate, ever. You can scale the image as
                big or as small as you want and the image will still look crisp. While it may take some getting used to, there are a ton of useful
                YouTube channels (such as Logos by Nick) and useful documentation on how to use this software with ease.

                The Monopoly board was the first thing I worked on. I didn't really know what I was doing with the first draft, but I kept on refining 
                the board until I got it to a point I like. If you decide to use Inkscape for this, please make sure to put each of the property tiles 
                in their own layer! As I found out, the file starts lagging if you don't do this! It may take some time to get the desired look, so

                    I had the idea to make a MASSIVE Monopoly back in 2020, in the thick of quarantine. I wanted an obscenely large game of Monopoly I could
                    play with family and friends. So what's a more comical way of doing this than building a 3 foot x 3 foot board to play on? (Haven't tested
                    the process, but it seems fun in the mind)

            <p class="piece-p2">
                The key for the game cards is to look on the internet for design ideas. Creating a card design idea can be tough, but with enough work,
                it will be done well. For my game, I decided to design the backs of the Monopoly board cards on my own, but the property deeds are inspired
                by the backs of the property deeds from the Mega Monopoly Edition. All the game cards are the same size in the original Monopoly game.

                <p class="wrapped-extra-p">
                    I wanted everything in my game to be massive, so the cards grew with the board. The choice of how each card grew was a choice based on the look of
                    it printed in a one to one ratio compared with the board. There was no set growth when creating the cards. However, not only did the card size grow,
                    but the amount of card decks as well. In Massive Monopoly. There are four decks of board cards (Chance, Chance 2, Community Chest, and Shopping Spree.
                    Which is similar to the bus ticket, found in the Mega Monopoly version. However, in my mind, more fun.) The title deeds have received one more title deed
                    (except for the railroads, they needed to keep the board symmetrical). I decided, the bigger, the better.

                The money you use for your Monopoly money doesn't have to be made by you. You could just take the already existing money from a Monopoly game
                that you have lying around. Make sure you have permission to use it though! You can, however, make your own Monopoly money from scratch. When
                I was making my money, I followed a <a href="https://youtu.be/HBSKPtbIU0U?si=B5jSy7hwBrFSv_dg" target="_blank">tutorial</a> from Logos by Nick.

                    I wanted the Massive Monopoly Money to be very similar to the money found in Mega Monopoly. As you could probably tell by now, I chose Mega Monopoly
                    to be the game I am basing my "expansion" on. I couldn't find a design I was happy with, so I had to settle (being the perfectionist I am, this
                    was saddening). Even so, the money now is going under its 3rd remodel and I like it more and more as the time goes on. If you have a better idea
                    for a design. Please contact me! I am open to suggestions!

                this was a fun thought, I'd advise you not to do this if you want to save money. If you still want to make custom tokens, make sure the dimensions
                of the tokens are what you really want and that you want to have the specific model of token. When I made mine, I found random trinkets off of

                make your own out of wood, plastic, acrylic or metal if you wanted to. I found these amazing dice on Amazon that really fit what I wanted for my game. Click
                here to take a look. The dice I got are made of metal alloy and are pretty hefty. I don't want them to damage my game when rolled, so I'm going to create a
                custom board game box that's lined with some soft material so nothing is damaged over long periods of use, but more on that later.

                with wood. I'll see what comes my way. The board design comes at a very late stage in the game because it's what advertises your game. You need to have a solid
